									<p>The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. 
										And Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.
										To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.
										I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup. 
										Below, we will take you through the task of Supply Chain Analysis using the Python programming language

									<p>Recession is calculated and analyzed according to the growth in GDP, the growth in the unemployment rate, and the growth in consumer spending rate. But the most common way of measuring recession is by analyzing the monthly GDP growth data.
										So, for the task of Recession analysis, we need to have a dataset of the monthly GDP growth of a country. 
										The severity of a recession refers to the extent to which the economy contracts during a recession. A severe recession involves a deeper and more prolonged decline in economic activity, resulting in negative effects on employment, incomes and other economic indicators.

									 For tracking conversion rate on a website </a></h2>

								<p>User funnel analysis is a way to understand how users interact with a website or an application. It helps businesses analyze the conversion rate from the page the user visited the website or the app to the page user left the website or the app.									
									Analyzing user funnels involves collecting and analyzing data related to user behaviour and actions at each stage of the funnel to understand how users progress through the different stages, and where they give up or exit.
									Here’s a dataset we collected from an e-commerce platform based on the flow of users on their platform. Below are all the features in the dataset: <br />
									1.	user_id: represents unique user identifiers. <br />
									2.	stage: represents the stage of the user’s journey through the funnel.<br />
									3.	conversion: indicates whether the user has converted or not. <br />
									Your task is to analyze user funnel data to understand the conversion journey of users. Identify the stages where users give up the most and the least. Are there specific stages where users tend to convert more frequently or less frequently? Provide visualizations and information to support your conclusions.

								<p>Understanding demand and supply is critical for businesses to optimize operations, maximize profits, and make informed decisions. Analyzing the demand and supply for cab ride businesses like Ola and Uber is one of the challenging use cases of demand and supply analysis. 
									Cab services have become an essential part of urban transportation, with people relying heavily on these services for their daily commutes. Understanding the demand and supply patterns of cab services can help optimize their operations and provide a better user experience to customers.
									Here is a dataset of the demand for rides and the supply of drivers in a particular city. Below are the features in the dataset: <br />
									1.	Drivers Active Per Hour: Number of drivers active per hour. <br />
									2.	Riders Active Per Hour: Number of Riders looking for rides. <br />
									3.	Rides Completed: Number of rides completed. <br />
									Your task is the analyze the demand for rides and the supply of cabs to understand demand and supply patterns.
